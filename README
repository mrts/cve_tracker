A script that parses the Python-related CVE list

http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=python

and classifies the CVEs as follows:

 * "ok" -- CVE has references to bugs.python.org,

 * "warnings" -- CVE has references to Python SVN revisions
   or an issue in bugs.python.org refers to it (i.e. the probelm is
   probably fixed, but the CVE should really be updated to link
   to the issue that is probably listed in bugs.python.org),

 * "errors" -- CVE does have no references to Python issues or SVN
   nor does any issue in bugs.python.org have references to the CVE ID.

In April 2010 there were 10 errors, 18 warnings and 5 CVEs were OK.

In an ideal world, the references would be symmetric, i.e. every
Python-related CVE would have references to one or more issues in
bugs.python.org and these issues would also refer back to the CVE ID.
